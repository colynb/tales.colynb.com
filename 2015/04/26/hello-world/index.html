<p>Thanks for subscribing to Tales from the Frontend. Iâ€™ve suspended this website and the newsletter for a bit, while I figure out how to re-invent myself. The good news is, you can still get daily frontend updates on my <a href="https://twitter.com/frontendd" target="_blank" rel="external">twitter feed</a> as well as my <a href="https://flipboard.com/@colynbrown/tales-from-the-frontend-84if74jay" target="_blank" rel="external">Flipboard magazine</a> of the same name.</p>
