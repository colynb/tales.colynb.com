Thanks for subscribing to Tales from the Frontend. I've suspended this website and the newsletter for a bit, while I figure out how to re-invent this thing. The good news is, you can still get daily frontend updates on my <a href="https://twitter.com/frontendd">twitter feed</a> as well as my <a href="https://flipboard.com/@colynbrown/tales-from-the-frontend-84if74jay">Flipboard magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TalesFromTheFrontend">Facebook page</a> of the same name.
